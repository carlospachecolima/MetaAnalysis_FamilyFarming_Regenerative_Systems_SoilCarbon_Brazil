Preliminary meta-analysis of soil organic carbon under regenerative agricultural systems in Brazilian family farming
Preliminary datasets from a meta-analysis on soil organic carbon under regenerative agricultural systems in Brazilian family farming

## Overview
This repository contains preliminary findings and forest plots from a meta-analysis assessing Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) responses to regenerative agricultural systems in Brazil. The study focuses on family farming contexts, comparing regenerative practices against conventional management across three main systems:
1.  **SPDH:** No-tillage vegetable systems (Sistema de Plantio Direto de Hortaliças).
2.  **SAF:** Agroforestry systems (Sistemas Agroflorestais).
3.  **ORG/AGRO:** Organic and agroecological management.

## Key Findings & Figures

### 1. Organic and Agroecological Systems (ORG/AGRO)
The random effects model revealed the highest overall mean SOC increase.
* **Mean Difference:** 10.52 [2.71; 18.33]
* **Heterogeneity ($I^2$):** 100%

### 2. No-tillage Vegetable Systems (SPDH)
SPDH consistently outperformed conventional systems in increasing surface SOC.
* **Mean Difference:** 5.27 [3.06; 7.48]
* **Heterogeneity ($I^2$):** 100%

### 3. Agroforestry Systems (SAF)
Agroforestry systems showed a moderate but statistically significant SOC increase.
* **Mean Difference:** 3.38 [0.62; 6.14]
* **Heterogeneity ($I^2$):** 95.9%

## Methodology Notes
* **Study Scope:** Field-scale experimental evidence in Brazilian family farming.
* **Statistical Model:** Random effects model (due to high heterogeneity).
* **Note:** Preliminary text written by Generative Artificial Intelligence with human results interpretation and text elaboration support.
